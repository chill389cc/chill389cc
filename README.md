### *A Little About Me*
- I'm a student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science.
- I'm currently living in Provo, UT and I hope to graduate in Winter of 2024.
- I’m interested in software engineering, improving work with software, code optimization, and more! Generally I'm interested in doing anything tech-related, but software is what I've picked to pursue.

### *What I'm Working On*
- I'm working as a full-stack software developer for the Office of IT on BYU Campus and I'm loving it! I mostly deal in NodeJS, Typescript, and Vue/Nuxt but I also have to use SQL, Terraform (on AWS), Svelte, and other languages. I'm familiar with testing in Postman and JMeter, deploying to AWS EC2 in docker through Github Actions.
  - All of our code is in a private organization so while you can't see exactly what I've worked on, you can see my contribution amounts in the graph below. 
  - Or, check out my Wakatime graph to see what languages I'm using!
- A friend and I were frustrated with managing terraform versions so we built [tfvm-windows](https://github.com/jsterner30/tfvm-windows)! It's simple to setup and use.

Cool Vercell Visualizations that I could use one day when I write more public code:
Shows my (public) stats:
https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=chill389cc

Shows which languages I like the most:
https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=chill389cc

both of these don't show things from private orgs though so I'm basically toast
